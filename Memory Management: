Certainly, I can provide you with a simple example in Java that demonstrates memory management concepts. In this example, I'll show you how to create a basic custom memory manager that allocates and deallocates memory blocks. Note that this is a simplified illustration and doesn't cover all the intricacies of real-world memory management systems.

```java
public class CustomMemoryManager {
    private byte[] memoryPool;
    private boolean[] allocatedBlocks;

    public CustomMemoryManager(int size) {
        memoryPool = new byte[size];
        allocatedBlocks = new boolean[size];
    }

    public int allocate(int size) {
        for (int i = 0; i < memoryPool.length - size + 1; i++) {
            boolean found = true;
            for (int j = i; j < i + size; j++) {
                if (allocatedBlocks[j]) {
                    found = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) {
                for (int j = i; j < i + size; j++) {
                    allocatedBlocks[j] = true;
                }
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1; // No available block
    }

    public void deallocate(int start, int size) {
        for (int i = start; i < start + size; i++) {
            allocatedBlocks[i] = false;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CustomMemoryManager memoryManager = new CustomMemoryManager(1024);

        int block1 = memoryManager.allocate(100);
        int block2 = memoryManager.allocate(200);

        if (block1 != -1 && block2 != -1) {
            System.out.println("Allocated block1 at position: " + block1);
            System.out.println("Allocated block2 at position: " + block2);

            memoryManager.deallocate(block1, 100);
            memoryManager.deallocate(block2, 200);

            System.out.println("Block1 deallocated.");
            System.out.println("Block2 deallocated.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Not enough contiguous memory for allocation.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `CustomMemoryManager` class that manages a simplified memory pool. The `allocate` method tries to find a contiguous block of memory of the requested size and marks it as allocated. The `deallocate` method releases the allocated memory by marking the corresponding blocks as available again.

Keep in mind that this is a basic simulation and doesn't consider many real-world complexities like fragmentation, allocation strategies, or concurrency issues. Real memory managers in operating systems are much more sophisticated and handle various challenges associated with memory management.
